    Paragraph
        TextNode "When you ask someone a question you want them to take time out of their day to\nhelp you. This means they are doing you a favor, so you should be considered\nof their time. Yes there is also paid support, but making the experience of\nhelping you more pleasant will get you better results either way."

        TextNode "2. No hello"
    Paragraph
        TextNode "Put the question into the first message you send them. Don't just say hello\nand wait for them to respond, don't ask if it would be ok if you'd ask them a\nquestion. Just put the question in the first message."
    Paragraph
        TextNode "Sure you can be polite but by putting the question into the first message you\nwill get much faster responses."

    Paragraph
        TextNode "Don't just tell me what went wrong, but also what you tried to do, what the\noutput was (if there is interesting output) and where the relevant code snipped\nis."
    Paragraph
        TextNode "However sharing too much information is just useless. If you share a screenshot of the\nrelevant function I might be able to debug it. But I definitely won't open a\nzip of the repository. Most likely because when I read your question I'm often on\nmobile and I am just not able to. But more importantly because it shows that\nyou didn't put much effort into your question and that you are not considered\nof my time. Therefore I just don't want to invest the time to hunt down a bug\nin an unknown codebase which might take quite a bit."

        TextNode "4. Consider you might be wrong"
    Paragraph
        TextNode "When you ask for help, you probably have a wrong understanding of how your\nsystem works. You also probably have an assumption on what happened, and you\nshould include them in the description. Just be careful that you also include\nan objective description on what actually did happen."
    Paragraph
        CommentNode "
During my time as a tutor I had some crazy question on the levels of:

> My program keeps segfaulting because gamma rays manipulate the binary,
> producing bad code, what to do?

Which, I guess, technically could happened but most likely is nothing of the
sorts but just you messing up memory management in C.

    Paragraph
        TextNode "While theses assumption sometimes are correct, and often the wrong ones are easy\nto spot out, sometimes they lead the helping person on the wrong track hindering\nthem to help you."

    Paragraph
        TextNode "If I see that you missed a semicolon on line 23, I want to tell you exactly\nthat. And no I won't start counting from the first line of the image or retype\nthe line (which is unintuitive to do so on mobile keyboards).\n"
